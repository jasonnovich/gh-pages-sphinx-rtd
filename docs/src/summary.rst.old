==========

My name is Jason and I am a freelance Technical Writer and Technical
Communicator. I am looking for freelance opportunities API
documentation, technical training, and other general technical
writing.

My passion is to ensure that companies of any size maximize their
technical communication. Along with my extensive experience in
technical support, and product management I uniquely positioned to
understand how users are using the product and what they are looking
to achieve. This perspective gives me the ability to author and
deliver content over any medium targeted to the company and the
users needs.
